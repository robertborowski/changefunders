      <h2 class="fw-bold custom-subheader-1 text-center">Social change today</h2>
      <p><span class="custom-ml-1">We</span> live in a time where criticism and outrage are looked at as virtuous and morally superior qualities in a person. Simply post your complaints on your preferred social media platform and you will be looked at as a hero in your community. People really believe that if they complain loud enough to be trending on social media then the complaints themselves will bring about societal change. This is shallow surface level thinking at best.</p>
      <p>Posting about social injustice will only get your cause so far, your words must be backed by real money in order to hold any real weight in this world. We’ve all heard the quote “be the change you want to see in the world” but at changefunders we believe you have to “fund the change you want to see in the world.”</p>
      <p>Changefunders is the leading donation subscription platform. At changefunders we believe that recurring + reliable monthly funds are the only way nonprofit organizations can plan for and execute lasting positive change in society.</p>
      <p>With changefunders you can donate to just about any nonprofit organzation that you want. In return we create your verified donator link that you can post to social media to prove that you truly lead by example as well as a monthly newsletter to keep you up to date on the social change topics that you care about. Donate to the social cause you support today in less than 60 seconds!</p>

      <h2 class="fw-bold custom-subheader-1 text-center">Donation subscription example: Prison industrial complex</h2>
      <p><span class="custom-ml-1">In</span> the United States the prison industry is increasingly viewed as modern day slavery that traps people into perpetual cycles of poverty and discrimination instead of attempting to rehabilitate and educate people back into functioning members of society. Organizations such as The Innocence Project, Reform Alliance, Vera Institute of Justice, and Families and Friends of the Wrongfully Convicted are just some of the organizations that are fighting to reform the prison industry, and help provide wrongfully convicted people with adequate resources to fight for their freedom.</p>
      <p>Fighting for freedom is not cheap. In order for these organizations to help free wrongfully convicted people they need money for lawyers, legal fines & fees, waivers, jail credits, bail, the legal costs go on and on. In order to cover these costs nonprofit organizations need to know that the money they are getting every month is reliable and that is where your changefunders donation subscription comes in to help the cause that you support.</p>

    <h2 class="fw-bold custom-subheader-1 text-center">But don't my taxes already pay for this kind of stuff?</h2>
    <p><span class="custom-ml-1">At</span> changefunders we do not believe that the government is going to solve all of our problems. A lot of your tax dollars go into the very institutions that cause you such frustration. The only way the government will reform these institutions is if you fight back by funding the organizations that you believe in.</p>
